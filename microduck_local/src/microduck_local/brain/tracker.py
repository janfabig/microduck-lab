"""A tracker over the detector's frames (roadmap 1.3's "tracker gives ids").

The detector returns per-frame detections; a brain that acts on the raw
list re-picks its target every frame (a ghost or a second person steals
it) and loses it the first frame it is missed. `Tracker` associates each
frame's detections with the tracks it already has — same class, nearest
bearing inside a gate, range not wildly different — smooths bearing and
range, counts hits, and COASTS a track through misses: with odometry, the
remembered bearing turns with the body, so a person the duck turns away
from is still "at −1.2 rad", not gone. Ghosts (no consistent position)
never reach the hit count a brain asks for. (The bearing turns with the
body's YAW; `TrackerParams.coast_from_xy` is the knob that also turns it with
the body's TRANSLATION, by re-reading it off the remembered position.)

In the sim the detector also hands out the true object name; the tracker
keeps it as `name` for the tools and tests, but its `id` is its own —
what the real robot will have.

        """A hit: the track's odometry-frame position, and a velocity sample
        against the previous hit when the two are usefully apart in time.

        KNOWN BIAS, not yet fixed here. `pos`/`yaw` are the pose the caller
        has NOW, while `t` is the frame's timestamp - so a hit is anchored
        where the duck is rather than where it was when the picture was
        taken, and `xy` carries about (duck speed x detector period) of
        error in the direction of travel: ~3 cm at 10 Hz, ~6 cm at 5 Hz.
        `brain/tidy.py`'s `stale_fix` was the same bug in the same shape and
        has now been measured. THE RESULT IS NOT "FIX IT HERE TOO".
        Correcting the placement alone LOST 0.38 toys (p = 0.031) even
        though it cut the estimate's error from 5.4 cm to 3.7 cm, because
        the stop distance downstream had been hand-fitted against the
        biased estimate and absorbed it. Only correcting BOTH won
        (+0.44 toys, grasp 88% -> 93%). See AGENTS.md rule 7.

        MEASURED HERE, and the answer is DON'T. 12 348 ball sightings over
        2 seeds x 180 s of 1v1, each placement checked against truth and
        split into what moved between the frame and now:

            frame age          100 ms (median)
            placement error    7.7 cm   <- what the brain acts on
            duck moved since   1.8 cm   <- THIS bias
            ball moved since   0.7 cm   <- what predict() is for

        and in the line-up case that actually scores (ball inside 0.6 m and
        nearly still, 6 253 of those sightings): 5.5 cm of error, 1.7 cm of
        it from the stale pose. **The error is dominated by neither term -
        it is the detector's own bearing and range noise.** Fixing the pose
        removes at most a third of it, and by rule 7 it would ALSO move the
        line-up off the constants fitted around it. Bad trade; not done.

        (An earlier version of this note said the ball moves 1.4 m/s and so
        `predict()` dominates. That is the peak right after a kick, not the
        operating point: at the median the ball has moved 0.7 cm since the
        frame. Most sightings are of a nearly stationary ball.)

        VELOCITY is less affected - both samples carry a similar error, so
        it largely cancels in the difference - but the POSITION does not,
        and `Track.xy` is what a dead-reckoned approach steers by.
