"""MOSS's model of the room: what it has seen, where it has looked, and where
to go when nothing is in view (2026-09-28).

Asked on /sim with one bottle cap left in `moss-yard`: "didn't it see that
cap before? why doesn't it go over there? do we need a map?" MOSS had no
memory of objects — only the one it was going for — and when nothing was in
view it spun on the spot, forever, unless a one-frame phantom detection (the
detector's modelled false positive, ~1 per 20 s) sent it across the yard.
Measured over two 15-minute runs: once only small objects were left, 10 of
the approaches were at phantoms, and the only way it ever reached the cap was
by chasing them.

Three pieces, all in the brain's ODOMETRY frame and built only from what the
robot has (its detections and its own pose):

* `ObjectMemory` — every toy seen, kept after it leaves the view. A sighting
  is CONFIRMED on its second detection within `gate_m`, which is also what
  keeps a phantom out: it never recurs in the same place. An entry is
  forgotten when the camera looks right at where it should be, from close
  enough that it would be found on every frame, and finds nothing.
* `Coverage` — when each patch of floor was last in the camera's view,
  within `cover_m`. For the map on /sim, and for choosing where to look.
* `Patrol` — when a full turn on the spot shows nothing: drive to the
  nearest remembered object and look at it from close up; with nothing
  remembered, drive the rim of the work area, `inset_m` in from its walls,
  turning to face the middle at every waypoint.

The WORK AREA was declared at first — the scenario's wall rectangle handed to
the brain, because the RealSense's depth was not modelled. Asked on /sim the
same day ("is it drawing those walls from the actual environment?"), it now
comes from MOSS's own sensing:

* `RoomMap` — an occupancy grid built from the depth scan
  (`robots/moss.DEPTH_SCAN_RAYS`: the D455f's depth row at the lens's 75 mm),
  in the odometry frame: every return marks its cell occupied and the cells
  the ray passed through free. The work area is the rectangle round what is
  solid, once the scans have swept most of a turn. And what the depth cannot
  see — anything under its 75 mm slice or inside its 0.52 m near limit — is
  FELT: a patrol leg that stalls against something marks it.

The declared area survives only as the fallback for a MOSS with no depth
(`tof: null`), and the /sim map says which one it is drawing. The map is
built on odometry, which is ideal in `moss-yard`; with drift the walls would
smear, which is what SLAM would correct and this does not.
