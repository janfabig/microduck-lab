**A sibling of `brain/tidy_arm.py`, not a subclass** — the repo's own rule for
a whole brain whose vocabulary differs. Three things are structurally
different from MARS's, and each one REMOVES machinery rather than adding it:

* **The bin rides on the robot.** MARS drives to a basket, servos onto its
  rim and places over it; `tidy_arm` has `carry`, `deliver` and `place`
  states for that leg and reads the basket's rim height out of the scenario.
  MOSS carries its bin behind the arm, so the delivery target is a FIXED arm
  pose (`moss.DROP_POSE`) and the whole leg collapses into one swing. There
  is nothing to re-find, nothing to line up, and nothing to drop short of.
* **No run-time IK.** The grasp point is fixed in the robot's own frame, so
  the four poses are constants measured once (`robots/moss.py`) and what
  varies is where the BASE is — which this brain was steering anyway.
* **The base does the last centimetres, not the arm.** MEASURED, and it is
  the whole reason this brain is shaped the way it is: his palm sits ~60 mm
  up the approach axis and his can is 115 mm tall, so an arm descending onto
  a standing can lands on its lid and stops 35 mm short; and swinging the arm
  out of the tuck with a can in front sweeps it 20 cm away inside 0.4 s. So
  the jaws go to can height while the can is still 0.55 m off, and then the
  robot drives it in. A litter-picker's own order.

**What it is worth, MEASURED, and the two numbers disagree on purpose.**

* SCRIPTED, in MOSS's own scene with the can placed by hand
  (`scripts/probe_moss_grasp.py`'s sibling): **5/5 lifted, 5/5 stowed**.
* THIS BRAIN, in `moss-yard` off its own camera, 300 s, seeds 0/1/2:
  **2/9 cans stowed** (1, 1, 0), from 11 grasp attempts.

The gap is the brain's, not the arm's, and the failure is always the same:
the can is knocked aside or toppled out of line during the creep instead of
entering the jaws, so the machine closes on air and stows nothing. A 25 mm
belief error at the moment of closing (measured, below) against a grasp band
of +-30 mm is most of it. Worth quoting as 0.67 cans per 5 minutes, and worth
nobody's confidence until the creep is re-measured.

The can TOPPLES as it enters the jaws and is carried lying down; nothing here
grasps an upright can.

**Untested on hardware**, like everything else about this body.

#: The run whose `policy.onnx` is the shipped pickup skill.
#:
#: **A TIE BROKEN ON PROVENANCE, not a measured win** (2026-09-24). This was
#: `moss-pick-v1` — an RL leg whose chain ran through the lab but whose final
#: fine-tune was a CLI run. `teach-moss_pick-5e9df7` is the same leg
#: continued through `/teach` at rung 2 for 500k, so it is lab-produced end
#: to end, which is what this workspace asks of a trained leg.
#:
#: They cannot be told apart on the number that matters. Cans delivered over
#: 48 seeds of `moss-yard`, 144 cans an arm:
#:
#:     moss-pick-v1             46/144  (32%)
#:     teach-moss_pick-5e9df7   39/144  (27%)      0.93 se apart
#:
#: and the gap SHRANK as power went up — 1.6 se at 72 cans, 0.93 at 144 —
#: which is what noise does. At this n the smallest detectable difference is
#: about 15 points and the observed one is 5; separating them honestly needs
#: roughly 1300 cans an arm, which is not worth buying for a leg that is not
#: the bottleneck. On instant picks they are exactly tied, 45/48 each.
#:
#: The incumbent keeps the better point estimate, so this is reversible by
#: design: put `moss-pick-v1` back here and nothing else changes. What is NOT
#: a reason to prefer either is `5e9df7`'s better sustained-grip score (81%
#: against 62%) — that is the criterion it was trained against, and the same
#: criterion measured WORSE delivery under optimisation, so crediting it
#: would be crediting the proxy that failed.
#:
#: 2026-09-26: SWITCHED to `teach-moss_pick-ad9876`, the six-shape pick, once
#: the brain could run it as it trained (wrist-camera slots, base locked —
#: read off its run.json by `_flags`) and hand it objects where it trained
#: (per-object range, size-relative carry squeeze). moss-yard, 12 seeds x
#: 300 s, cans + block + squat + ball: ad9876 38/72, 5e9df7 37/72 (paired
#: +0.08 +- 0.42 per seed — a tie on the total); ad9876 delivers blocks 6/12
#: and balls 5/12 against 1/12 and 2/12, 5e9df7 squat cans 12/12 against 7/12.
#: Chosen for the shapes. Reversible: put "teach-moss_pick-5e9df7" back.
#: 2026-09-27: -> `teach-moss_pick-478dad`, ad9876 fine-tuned for objects
#: CLOSE IN (spawn 0.22-0.34 m) on the reward ad9876 actually trained under
#: (`gap_from_tcp` — unrecorded until now; three fine-tunes without it
#: learned to DRAG objects in). Deep picks in its env 81/78/90% at
#: 0.22-0.28/0.28-0.34/0.36-0.42 m against ad9876's 65/75/93%, card close in
#: 8/11 against 2/11, no dragging (-5.9 cm). moss-yard, 6 seeds x 300 s,
#: handover 0.41 m: 19/48 against 16/48. Reversible: "teach-moss_pick-ad9876".

    #: STOP THE TRACKS ONCE THE ARM CAN REACH IT. The pickup policy drives
    #: the base flat out for the whole grab: measured over 29,165 creep ticks,

    #: 0.200 m/s and |wz| at a median 0.808 rad/s with 78% of ticks turning

    #: It is also where the cans go: 158 of 434 can-touches in a run are the

    #: RAMP THE TRANSITIONS, don't step them. `lift`, `stow` and `release`
    #: already ramp and are calm — max 2.00, 2.37 and 0.67 rad/s. `deploy`
    #: and `tuck` commanded their pose outright and are not: p95 9.47 and

    #:
    #: Pacing the blends fixes the blends. It cannot fix a STATE TRANSITION,
    #: which is a step input by construction: `ramp_from_achieved` starts each
    #: leg at where the arm IS, and a servo under load lags its command, so
    #: the first tick of `lift` jumps by exactly that lag. MEASURED over eight
    #: 300 s moss-yard seeds with the blends already paced: the worst one-tick
    #: command step is still 0.122-0.449 rad, and every one of the eight is in
    #: `lift`. 0.449 rad in 20 ms is a 22 rad/s demand.
    #:
    #: This clips the command to the LAST COMMAND +- cap*dt, which is what a
    #: real servo bus would do anyway. It cannot silently stall a plan: every
    #: blend is paced under the same cap, so the limiter only ever has a
    #: transition's lag to pay off, and it pays it off in ceil(lag/cap*dt)
    #: ticks. The GRIPPER is deliberately outside it — its travel is 41 mm of
    #: slide on its own servo, and nothing here has measured that servo's
    #: rate, so capping it would be a number I made up.

    #: to do: the worst one-tick step falls 0.449 -> 0.060 rad, the arm's time
    #: on the floor 6661 -> 1979 substeps and the hardest floor contact
    #: 151 -> 118 N. But delaying the command leaves the arm arriving late,
    #: and the numbers that decide whether a servo survives got WORSE: the
    #: longest unbroken stall at the 2.2 N m clamp 0.99 -> 3.88 s, arm-on-bin
    #: contact 3310 -> 6243 substeps at 118 -> 190 N, and peak joint speed
    #: 6.9 -> 10.4 rad/s (gravity, not a command — the limiter does not hold
    #: the arm up). A 3.9 s stall is the exact failure this pass exists to
    #: remove, so this stays off and the transition step stays open: the fix

    #: Nor is any of this a depth problem: `range_from_detector` ranges each
    #: object by its apparent width in the COLOUR image, and the depth row
    #: only builds the obstacle map. The camera sees them. The brain binned
    #: the detection.
    #:
    #: And `_toys_in_view` feeds `_remember` as well as `_see`, so such an
    #: object was not merely passed over as a target — it never entered
    #: `ObjectMemory` at all. This splits the two floors so it can: the
    #: targeting floor is untouched (lowering `min_x` itself was tried and
    #: doubled the drops — the jaws cannot work at 0.2 m), while the memory
    #: keeps the sighting, and the patrol's `choose` phase can then route

    #: this time — the reason is in what those thousand rejected detections
    #: are OF. Broken down by brain state, they land in `creep`, `pinch`,
    #: `lift`, `stow`, `tuck`, `deploy` and `release`: the arm is out and the
    #: close thing in frame is the object in the jaws or the one being
    #: reached for. Only **15/26/0 per run happen in `search`** and 4/16/13
    #: in `approach`, and `_remember` (which runs per detector FRAME, not per

    #: detections per 300 s run**. Counting what a filter discards is not

        backing off is not something this should do, and that is MEASURED
        rather than assumed.

        The first version of this drove the can to the middle of the box the
        policy trains in (`moss.PICK_HANDOVER_BOX`), on the argument that a
        policy is competent where it was trained. It doubled the in-band
        share, 28% -> 67%, and delivered one FEWER can. Tagging every
        handover with where it started and whether it reached a lift says
        why — the box is not the ranking:

            too NEAR  x < 0.36      8/11   73%
            IN BAND   0.36-0.55     5/13   38%

            too WIDE  |y| > 0.12    1/5    20%

        Nearer is better, not worse, so parking at the band's middle threw
        away the best cell it had. What actually loses attempts is the
        LATERAL offset: the policy's env spawns |y| <= 0.12 and the room
        hands it cans up to 0.297 m off to one side, and those convert at
        20%. So the gate closes in when the can is beyond the box and turns
        to centre it when it is off to the side, and otherwise gets out of
        the way. (11, 13, 18 and 5 attempts: the wide and near cells are
