"""The last metre, learned: a kick that SEES the ball (roadmap 12h / E.1,
2026-09-10).

12b put the ball anywhere in the box play produces and paid the swing that
connects across it - blind. That recipe took the grid's box coverage from
the vendored strike's 69-82 % to 82-99 %, and the gym whiff from 18 % to
4 %, and there it stops: a blind sweep cannot refuse a ball it cannot reach
and cannot step to one. 12aj measured what is left - the ball is a median
10 cm ahead at the swing, but 11 % of swings are at a ball more than 15 cm
ahead and those whiff 44 %, and *nothing that reads the belief can refuse
them, because the belief is what is wrong*. 12ak then bought the fresh
sighting (58 % of swings, track age 1.54 s -> 0.14 s) and every way of
ACTING on it - declining, re-laying, gating - whiffed more, and closed with
the ask this recipe answers: "the lever that would USE a fresh sighting is
a kick that adapts to where the ball is".

So: the wide kick's world, the wide kick's pay, and the ball in the
observation.

**The slots.** `find_ball`'s rule (AGENTS.md: "a task the robot must SENSE
puts its sensing in the command slots, in the robot's own terms"), with the
same four HEAD slots, obs[51:55], and the 61-dim layout untouched:

  [51] bearing  the ball's bearing in the DUCK's own yaw frame, psi/(pi/2),
                + = to the LEFT, clipped to +-1. 0 while nothing is known.
  [52] range    ground distance from the trunk to the ball, / LM_RANGE_SCALE,
                clipped to 0..1. 0 while nothing is known.
  [53] seen     1.0 while the detector's last report had the ball in it.
  [54] conf     freshness of the estimate: 1.0 on a fresh report, fading
                exp(-t/LM_MEM_TAU) while the report says nothing, 0.0 before
                the first sighting of the episode.

Body frame, not camera frame, and that is deliberate: the detector reports a
bearing across the FRAME, and the daemon's tracker adds the camera's own yaw
to it before anyone consumes it (`Tracker._associate`; AGENTS.md verification
rule 8 is about exactly this frame). A camera-frame bearing confounds the
head's pose into the signal - the same number means a different ball
depending on where the neck is - and this policy is asked to put a FOOT on
the ball, which is a body-frame errand. What rides the slots is therefore
what the daemon hands a consumer, and every step of producing it is
something the robot can do:

  * the ball is projected through the MJCF `head_camera` exactly as
    `find_ball` does it (`_ball_camera`), with find_ball's own FOV knobs -
    one source for the camera, so a lens change cannot mean two things here
    (AGENTS.md: "a characterisation that silently inherits a default");
  * `seen` is the detector's, not the truth's: in frame in BOTH axes and
    inside MAX_RANGE, sampled at the detector's cadence (25 Hz against the
    50 Hz control loop) and jittered in normalized bearing units when the
    env is randomizing;
  * the jittered bearing pair is turned back into a ray and intersected with
    the floor plane - the ground-plane placement a daemon does with head
    encoders and the IMU, no range sensor needed;
  * that world point is HELD while the report says nothing and re-expressed
    in the current body frame every step, which is odometry. Over a 2 s
    episode that is what the robot's own odometry gives it.

The reward reads the truth (the ball's speed along the kick line), as every
reward here does; the obs never does.

**The pay is the wide kick's, to the term** (`kick._kick_terms` plus 12ab's
`face_line` anchor) - so this recipe and `kick_{side}_wide` differ in the
OBSERVATION and in nothing else that is paid. AGENTS.md: a stage may ladder
the world, never the pay.

**The approach rung** (12as follow-up). The first cut learned to kick a
ball it can see and NOT to walk to one: with the ball 0.22-0.45 m ahead the
trunk advanced 1-11 cm in the 2 s clip and the ball never moved. By the
playbook that is a world fix, not a reward one - "if rollouts never contain
the skill you are paying for, fix the physics curriculum, not the reward",
because an unsampled state's value is never learned. Stage 3 therefore
spawns HALF its episodes with the ball 0.20-0.45 m ahead and up to 0.13 m
either side - beyond anything a swing from standing reaches - and doubles
the clip to 4 s, which is what the shipped walker needs to cover the gap
(`walker-facts`: 0.13-0.18 m/s forward, feet reaching 0.04 m past the
trunk, so 0.29 m of approach is 1.6-2.2 s) plus a swing. Not one point of
new pay: `ball_forward` already pays only for a ball that ROLLS, and the
only way to earn it from out there is to arrive first.

MEASURED (`scripts/probe_kick_approach.py`, 8 seeds a cell, warm-started
from the v1 tips as `lastmetre-{right,left}-v1-approach`): the rung buys the
band 0.20-0.24 m and stops dead. The right foot goes from 5 cm of trunk
advance and a ball that never moves at 0.22 m to 13-17 cm and the ball
kicked on 75-100 % of seeds, and the render is a walk - three alternating
single-support steps with the range slot falling 0.85 -> 0.58, then the
swing at ~1.2 s. Past 0.25 m nothing: 2-5 cm of advance, ball never moved,
both feet down for the whole clip. The cliff is between 0.24 and 0.26 m,
which is LM_RANGE_SCALE - and that is the whole explanation. For a ball
straight ahead, EVERY slot is identical past that radius (bearing 0, range
clipped to 1.0, seen 1, conf 1.0), so walking changes nothing the policy can
see and there is no gradient to climb. A second 2M-step arm with the far
window marched to 0.25-0.35 m (`lastmetre-{right,left}-approach-far`) moved
the cliff by nothing while proving the BODY is not the limit: the right foot
covers 1.03 m in 4 s chasing a ball it can range on. The approach is an
OBSERVATION problem, not a curriculum one; the next cut raises
LM_RANGE_SCALE, which is a new obs contract and therefore a new recipe id,
not an edit to this one. `tests/test_lastmetre.py` pins the saturation.

**The ladder is spawns only.** Stage 1 puts the ball in the 6 x 6 cm box
round the sweet spot AND pins the gaze to the down END of its range, where
the geometry says the ball is actually in frame (at a level head the camera
sits 0.21 m above a ball on the floor, so a ball 0.10 m ahead is 65 deg below
the optical axis and outside the half-VFOV - a level duck cannot see its own
feet, which is 12k's finding). Stage 2 opens the box to the one play
produces, at the whole gaze range the finished policy is handed over at, so
it still has to swing blind at the poses where there is nothing to see.

**2026-09-11: those two windows are the LANDSCAPE windows** (the camera is
mounted 116 deg across, 60 deg up - `behaviors/ball.py`). The half-VFOV is
30 deg, not 58, so the pitch the gaze needs is the whole question and the
head yaw is nearly free (half-HFOV 58 deg). Measured with this module's own
projection, `_lm_sense`'s `seen` at spawn, ball swept over the box and the
gaze drawn from the window (roadmap 12as follow-ups J and K):

    window                                    portrait 60x116  landscape 116x60
    the OLD drill (-0.30,-0.15 / 0.45,0.60), spot     100 %             0 %
    the OLD tip   (-0.30,0 / 0,0.60), full box         25 %             1 %
    LM_GAZE_STAGE1 below, on the spot                 100 %           100 %
    LM_GAZE_STAGE1 below, on the full box              99 %            97 %
    LM_GAZE_TIP below, on the full box                 53 %            70 %

(400 draws a cell, right foot; the left is within 2 pp of every cell. The
two windows below are not a portrait/landscape trade: they are better than
the shipped ones under BOTH reads of the camera, which is what you would
expect of windows chosen by measuring rather than by reasoning.)

`tests/test_lastmetre.py` locks both bars against the default camera, so a
remount that is not followed through into these two windows fails loudly
rather than training a policy that sees nothing.

**The far-range pair, `kick_{side}_sensed_far`** (12as's "next cut"). The
approach cliff above is the range slot's own ceiling, so the cut is to raise
it: LM_RANGE_SCALE_FAR = 0.60 m, which puts the WHOLE of stage 3's far window
(0.20-0.45 m) inside the informative part of obs[52] instead of pinned at
1.0. That is a different observation, not a different curriculum: the same
ball at the same place reads 1.00 under the 0.25 recipe and 0.42 under this
one. So it is a NEW RECIPE ID rather than an edit to `kick_{side}_sensed` -
every policy 12as and its follow-ups measured was trained against the 0.25
meaning of that slot, and silently re-scaling it would make all of them read
their own range wrong while every test and table still passed. Everything
else is shared to the line: the same four slots with the same bearing / seen
/ conf encoding, the same pay (`kick._kick_terms` + `face_line`), the same
four spawn-only stages, the same spawn knobs. The two ids differ in ONE
number, which is what makes them a controlled pair.

# - and nothing else is:
#
#   * head_pitch: play hands over at a median +0.548 off HOME, p90 +0.583,
#     into `LM_GAZE_TIP_HEAD`, which STARTS at +0.60. The two distributions
#     are disjoint; coverage 3 %. Verified from the spawn side too, off 40
#     resets of the running env: +0.611 .. +1.169.
#   * head_yaw: a median 0.31 rad TOWARD the kicking foot, into a window of
#     +-0.03 (the walk env's own pose noise, since `LM_GAZE_YAW` is (0, 0)).
#     Coverage 6 %.
#   * and the four axes this spawn cannot express at all: the duck arrives
#     MID-STRIDE (max |joint vel| median 5.4 rad/s, trunk yawing 1.2 rad/s,
#     rolling 2.6) while `walk_env.reset` does `qvel[:] = 0.0`, measured as
#     exactly 0.0000 on all 40 resets.
#
# One handover of 758 lands inside every windowed axis at once.
#
# **The rival fix on the gaze axis is already measured dead.** `ChaseParams`
# (controllers.py, under "AND THAT IS WHY RAISING `head_down` DOES NOTHING")
# reports `head_down` 0.6 -> 1.0 moving the median camera depression only
# 0.245 -> 0.339 rad and no kick metric at all, because `_gaze` aims the axis
# AT the ball and the clamp binds in under a tenth of frames. The brain cannot

#            trunk's height, roll and pitch, its linear and angular velocity,
#            and the ball's offset and velocity. Distributional skill-chaining
#            itself.
#

    re-expressed by odometry while nothing is reported — so it drifts, and a
    policy learning to act on it is learning to act on the drift. Reward
    curves cannot show that and a caption of numbers barely can.

    `_lm_world` is the believed world point itself, read off the env rather
    than reconstructed from the slots: the slots are CLIPPED and normalized
    (bearing to +-1, range to `_lm_range_scale`), so inverting them would draw
    a ghost the policy never saw — pinned to the clip whenever the ball is
    outside the window. `conf` is the memory's own decay and `seen` whether
    the last report had it in frame, which together say how much of what is
    drawn is a sighting and how much is dead reckoning.

    None for a recipe that does not write these slots (every trick, and the
    blind kicks — which is the honest answer: a blind kick has no belief)."""
