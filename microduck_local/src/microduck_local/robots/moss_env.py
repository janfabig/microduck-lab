"""What MOSS can be TRAINED to do: drive a can into its jaws and lift it.

**One task, and it is deliberately the SEGMENT that fails.** The scripted
`brain/tidy_moss.py` drives, tucks, deploys, stows and folds back, and it
lands 2 cans in 9 over three 5-minute runs. Every failure is in the same
30 cm: the can is knocked aside or toppled out of line during the creep, so
the jaws close on air. So that is what this env trains — from the deployed
pose, with the arm already at `moss.GRASP_POSE` and the jaws open, bring the
can between the pads and hold it. Search, approach, stow and tuck stay code.

That split is this repo's own, on its other wheeled arm: `reach` and `pick`
are trained envs and `brain/tidy_arm.py` is a scripted brain that sequences
them (`docs/mars-roadmap.md` Phase 4/5). It is also what makes the result
exportable: the policy is an ONNX under `moss.CONTRACT_ID`, 32 floats in and
9 out at 25 Hz, which a code skill on his Jetson can run under onnxruntime
while DimOS sequences the behaviours around it.

**The physics this env inherits, all of it measured first** (`robots/moss.py`
carries the tables): the jaw holds his 66 mm can at 2-6 mm of interference
and ejects it at 10; the grasp point is fixed in the base frame so the BASE
is what has to move; the room's props carry `priority 1`, so without
`moss.tune_contacts` the litter's own frictionless-in-torsion model governs
every grip and nothing can be held at all. Training before those were known
would have optimised a reward against a grasp that physically cannot close.

**The ladder is in the SPAWN BOX, not in the weights** (AGENTS.md: if the
rollouts never contain the skill, fix the physics curriculum). A policy that
never once has a can between its pads never learns to close on one:

    rung 0   the can spawns BETWEEN the pads (0.25-0.27 m, |y| < 0.015)
    rung 1   just outside them               (0.30-0.36 m, |y| < 0.04)
    rung 2   the brain's own creep distance  (0.36-0.55 m, |y| < 0.12)

**Untested on hardware.** Nothing here has driven a MOSS.

#

# policy earns for however much nearer the can got to the pocket and loses the
# same for pushing it away, so an episode's total IS the ground it made up and
# a robot that shoves the can around earns nothing.
W_PROGRESS = 60.0
#: ONE-SHOT, the first time the jaws close on the can in an episode — the
#: stepping stone between "drive it into the pocket" and "lift it".
#:
#: It has to be one-shot and it has to exist, and both halves were learned
#: the hard way. Paid PER STEP (at 0.3) a policy crushed the can and sat on
#: it for 199 of 200 steps; removed entirely, the next policy learned to
#: drive the can to within 5 mm of the pocket and then never close at all —
#: 0/12 grips — because closing earned nothing until the can was already
#: airborne, and it can never be airborne until something closes. An
#: unsampled state's value is never learned. A bonus that fires once cannot
#: be farmed and still marks the doorway.
W_CLOSE_BONUS = 6.0
#: Per step while the can is in the pocket AND the jaws are shut on it. SMALL,
#: and it was 2.0 for one afternoon: a crude close-and-hold script earned
#: +140 an episode on that alone, which is a policy that parks its jaws on a
#: can and collects for the rest of the run. `robots/mars_env.py` records the
#: same failure in the same words ("the policy parks the claw on the block").
#: It exists only to make CLOSING attractive before anything has ever lifted.
W_HELD = 0.3
#: Per metre GAINED in height while held — progress-pay, like the gap term,
#: so standing still with a can in the jaws earns nothing and the only way to
#: keep earning is to keep raising it.
W_LIFT = 120.0
#: Once, on a completed pick. Bounded, so it cannot be farmed.
SUCCESS_BONUS = 20.0
#: Once, when the can leaves the reachable band. Not a big number: a clumsy
#: approach that shoves the can 5 cm is a bad attempt, not a catastrophe, and
#: a large penalty here teaches the policy to stand still.
KNOCKED_PENALTY = -3.0
#: **Per metre the can is SHOVED while not yet held.** `KNOCKED_PENALTY`
#: alone was not a cost on shoving: it only fires when the can leaves a
#: 60 x 60 cm band, so a policy could push it 20 cm for free while earning
#: `W_PROGRESS` 60/m for closing. It did exactly that — 100% of creep ticks
#: command base motion, saturated, and the chassis is a third of all
#: can-contacts. Cans then accumulate at the walls, which is where shoved
#: things stop: 6 of 9 undelivered cans end within 0.25 m of one, and they
#: get there by being knocked rather than by spawning there.
#:
#: Set against `W_PROGRESS` deliberately: moving the can a centimetre now
#: costs about half what closing a centimetre earns, so approaching is still
#: worth it and barging is not. Only while NOT held — once the jaws have it,
#: moving the can IS the task.
#: -30 was MEASURED and it is too blunt: it charges for the can moving AT
#: ALL, so the policy learned to hesitate everywhere rather than to approach
#: cleanly. Cans shoved fell 20.9 cm -> 6.5 cm (the term works) but creep
#: conversion fell 67% -> 52% and deliveries 55/72 -> 43/72. Kept small, as a
#: nudge against barging, with the SPECIFIC failure priced below instead.
W_CAN_DISTURB = -5.0
#: **Per step the can is in contact with the ROBOT'S BODY while not held.**
#: The failure this names was described by a human watching the lab — "it's
#: kind of scooting it and then running into the body" — and it measures: 6
#: of 24 episodes drive the can into the hull, gripper mount or track before
#: gripping it, first contact happening while the grasp gap is still 81 mm.
#:
#: This is the difference between moving the can (sometimes necessary, and
#: what `W_CAN_DISTURB` over-charged for) and RAMMING it into the chassis,
#: which is never useful: the pocket is between the pads, so a can against
#: the hull is a can that has to be backed out of and re-approached, and on
#: the real robot it is a can wedged in the tracks.
W_CAN_BODY_HIT = -3.0
#: **Per step a PAD hits the can with its leading or trailing EDGE** rather
#: than with the face that grips. A pad grips on its inner face; a contact
#: whose normal runs along the pad's forward axis is the gripper barging the
#: can sideways, which is how a can ends up knocked over and out of reach.
#:
#: MEASURED on the shipped leg over 24 episodes at rung 2, classifying every
#: pad-vs-can contact normal in the PAD's own frame:
#:
#:     pad_right  front/back edge   1030
#:     pad_left   front/back edge    940
#:     pad_left   GRIP face          611
#:     pad_right  GRIP face           21
#:
#: **54% of all pad contact is edge-on**, against 17% on the faces that hold
#: it, in every one of 24 episodes at a median 97 ticks each. So the policy
#: spends most of its contact budget pushing the can with the wrong surface.
#: Priced per step, and swept through the environment because the right
#: weight is a question rather than a constant.
W_PAD_EDGE_HIT = float(os.environ.get("MICRODUCK_MOSS_PAD_EDGE", "-0.08"))
#: The pads, and how square a contact has to be to count as the grip face.
#: A normal is assigned to the axis it lies closest to, so this is simply
#: "which of the pad's three axes took the load".
PAD_GEOMS = ("pad_left", "pad_right")
#: **Turning the BASE, charged above turning the ARM.** `W_BASE_EFFORT`
#: prices forward and yaw the same and prices both at almost nothing, so the
#: policy solves a lateral offset by swinging the whole vehicle.
#:
#: MEASURED at rung 2: the can sits 7.8 degrees off centre at the median and
#: 15.5 at worst, and the base yaw travels 75 DEGREES per episode to reach
#: it — while `shoulder_pan`, which spans +-110 degrees and could cover that
#: bearing many times over, travels a near-identical 74. Two joints doing
#: the same job, one of which moves 4.3 kg of robot.
#:
#: This is not only wasteful, it is the difference between a manoeuvre that
#: is safe in a room and one that is not: an arm that pans sweeps its own
#: envelope, and a chassis that yaws sweeps the furniture. Raised by a human
#: watching it in the lab — "we don't need to rotate the whole robot, that
#: could have real world implications because it could be running into
#: stuff."
W_BASE_YAW = float(os.environ.get("MICRODUCK_MOSS_BASE_YAW", "-0.08"))

#: never meet on its way into the jaws. The PADS and the palm are excluded —

#: Contact noise below this per step is not a shove. The can jitters at rest
#: on a condim-6 contact and charging for that would tax standing still.
CAN_DISTURB_DEADBAND_M = 0.0005
#: Paid when a proved hold does NOT survive the ramp to the carry pose. It
#: has to cost more than the hold earned, or a policy banks the hold bonus
#: and lets the can go on the way up.
DROP_ON_LIFT_PENALTY = -30.0
#: **Driving costs something**, per control step, as a fraction of the
#: envelope. MEASURED on the live checkpoint at 100k steps, evaluated on the
#: rung it trained on: 50, 54 and 57 forward/back sign changes in 200 steps,
#: 0.61-0.76 m of path for 0.07-0.28 m of travel, and the can shoved from
#: 0.012 m to 0.105 m away. With a free base and a progress-paid gap, jiggling
#: nets zero and costs nothing, so the policy jiggles — and a tracked chassis
#: rocking on top of a can is how the can leaves.
#:
#: Small, and flat rather than ramped: at 0.20 it also suppressed the
#: APPROACH at rung 2, which is the thing the base is for. This is the term
#: `AGENTS.md` warns about most, so it is weighted to be felt when there is
#: nothing to do and ignored when there is somewhere to be.
#: **Raisable only now that driving is OPTIONAL.** Until 2026-09-25 the
#: hand-over contract reached past the arm (0.55 m against a 0.508 m reach),
#: so the base was doing necessary work on a third of episodes and no weight
#: here could have removed the driving without removing the grasp — which is
#: exactly what the -0.08 base-yaw and -0.04 effort terms failed to do, twice.
#: With the contract inside reach (`moss.PICK_HANDOVER_BOX`), the arm can take
#: every can from a standing start and this becomes a real lever.
W_BASE_EFFORT = float(os.environ.get("MICRODUCK_MOSS_BASE_EFFORT", "-0.04") or -0.04)
#: Action-rate, tiny. The duck's ramped version drove the G1's idle to -92
#: (AGENTS.md, "a ramped penalty can eat its task"), so this one is flat.
#: **Jerk, and it was priced at nothing.** MEASURED on the shipped leg: the
#: summed |delta action| is 1.127 per step at the median and reaches 8.000,
#: which is all eight channels flipping rail to rail inside one 40 ms tick.
#: Over an episode that totals 83, costing 0.83 against a success bonus of
#: 20 — four per cent of the prize for behaviour a human watching described
#: as erratic, and for base commands that sit saturated 100% of the time.
#:
#: Raised to 0.03, so the same jerk costs ~12% instead of 4%. NOT higher on
#: purpose: a blanket can-displacement penalty was set at -30 earlier the
#: same day, cut shoving 21 cm -> 6.5 cm exactly as intended, and cost 12
#: cans of 72 because the policy learned to hesitate rather than to move
#: cleanly. A smoothness term is the same kind of blunt instrument.

#
# So the observation carries a FIX — the last thing the camera reported —
# carried forward by the base's own motion between frames, exactly as
# `brain/tidy_moss.py` carries it, and `OBS_TARGET_SEEN` goes to 0 when it is
# stale. The REWARD still reads the truth: the env knows where the can is, and

# convenient.

#: Past this the can is under the camera's near edge and simply not in

#: vertical field first sees the floor at ~0.12 m), and explicitly NOT a
#: depth cutoff. Laurent's correction, 2026-09-24: valid depth on a D455f
#: starts around **0.52 m** and depends on configuration, so there is no

#: actually hands over at. Training stage 3 that way would have fed the
#: policy three dead inputs and then handed the robot live ones.
#:
#: A silhouette DOES give an axis (the bounding box's long side, the same

FRONT_AXIS_DROPOUT = 0.15

#:     attitude slots filled                    0/12 picked

#: So filling them is not a harder task, it is a BROKEN OBSERVATION for an old

GAP_TCP_SCALE = float(os.environ.get("MICRODUCK_MOSS_GAP_SCALE", "1") or 1.0)
#: **A DENSE aim, not a progress-paid one.** `W_JAW_ALIGN` pays the IMPROVEMENT

#: limit the policy pays nothing to sit against.
#:
#: MEASURED 2026-09-25 on `teach-moss_pick-2df5ad-s3`, 1,700 control ticks:
#:
#:     joint            at the torque clamp    over 0.75 rad/s

#:     wrist_roll               0.4%                0.6%
#:
#: `shoulder_lift` — the joint holding the arm up against gravity — is at
#: stall for more than a third of every episode. On hardware that is a servo
#: that heats, lags and winds up its PID, and when the load shifts it releases:
#: the same joint reaches 6.15 rad/s peak against a commanded rate of 0.75
#: (the action is an increment of +-0.03 rad at 25 Hz). That is the violence a
#: human watching the lab described, and nothing in the reward mentions it.
#:
#: NOT a substitute for a real envelope. A faithful BAM for these servos needs
#: the STS3215's stall torque and no-load speed MEASURED, which is Laurent's
#: to give — until then this charges for living at the clamp rather than
#: pretending the clamp is free.
W_TORQUE_SAT = float(os.environ.get("MICRODUCK_MOSS_TORQUE_SAT", "0") or 0.0)

#: **DRAGGING THE GRIPPER ALONG THE FLOOR.** Nothing stopped it: MEASURED
#: 2026-09-25 on the best policy, an arm or gripper geom is on the floor for
#: 3.9% of control ticks and the base is DRIVING for 3.2% of them — i.e.
#: almost every floor contact is a scrape under power, and it is the pads
#: doing it (pad_left 52 contacts, pad_right 7). On the real robot that is the
#: fingers being dragged across a floor, taking whatever is on it with them,
#: and the servos loaded sideways in the one axis they are weakest.
#: Charged per step, and harder while the base moves, because resting a pad on
#: the floor is untidy and dragging it is damage.

ARM_FLOOR_DRIVE_MPS = 0.1
#: **COME AT IT FROM ABOVE.** Charged per step the tool point is BELOW the
#: object's top while still outside grasp radius — an approach that arrives
#: low hits the can's side and knocks it over, which is what the palm-on-the-
#: rim measurement showed (30% of contacts at 115 mm on a 115 mm can). Today
#: that is 7.6% of ticks; the gripper is above the top 47.7% of the time, so
#: it already knows how, just not reliably.
W_LOW_APPROACH = float(os.environ.get("MICRODUCK_MOSS_LOW_APPROACH", "0") or 0.0)
#: **TAKE THE BASE AWAY FROM THE PICK.** Not a penalty — penalties failed at
#: this five times, because until the hand-over contract came inside the arm's
#: reach the base was doing NECESSARY work and no weight can price away a
#: motion the task requires.
#:
#: It no longer is. MEASURED 2026-09-25 over 60,000 arm configurations with
#: the base held still, the gripper covers the whole `PICK_HANDOVER_BOX`
#: (0.36-0.47 m, |y| <= 0.12) from a standing start. And MEASURED on the
#: policy trained right after that fix, it still drives 17.1 cm per episode
#: and turns 18.8 deg, because it was warm-started from one that had to and
#: 800k steps at -0.30 did not unlearn the habit.
#:
#: So the base is simply not this policy's to command: the APPROACH leg drives,
#: the PICK leg reaches. That is the split the scripted demo has and the one a
#: human watching the lab keeps asking for. `PICK_BASE_REACH_SCALE` damps the
#: base INSIDE a radius and its own notes record that damping at DEPLOY time
#: made things worse (9/14/8/15 cans of 36 against 22) because a policy that
#: steers with its base loses its manifold without it — which is the argument
#: for TRAINING without one, not for leaving it.
BASE_LOCK = os.environ.get("MICRODUCK_MOSS_BASE_LOCK", "0") not in ("", "0")
#: **THE WRIST CAMERA KNOWS HOW CLOSE THE CAN IS, AND WE THREW IT AWAY.**
#: `_sense_arm` computes the camera-to-can distance every tick, uses it only to
#: decide whether the can is in frame, and discards it — so the one sensor that
#: WORKS at grasp range reported orientation and nothing else.
#:
#: The front camera cannot fill this in: Laurent's correction of 2026-09-24 is
#: that a D455f's valid depth starts near 0.52 m, and the whole pick happens at
#: 0.36-0.47 m, entirely inside its blind zone (see `DET_MIN_RANGE_M`). So the
#: policy has had NO proximity signal during the grasp at all — it could not
#: know it was about to run into the can, which is exactly what a human
#: watching the lab kept describing.
#:
#: Published in place of slot 26, the can's HEIGHT off the front camera, which
#: MEASURED carries sd 0.0054 m across every pose — a constant — and is now
#: redundant with slot 30 (uprightness) and slot 31 (the object's top). The
#: wrist range carries sd 0.0605 m over 0.006-0.375 m, 11x the information in
#: the slot it replaces.
#:
#: Deployable: this is a monocular range off the SAME bounding box the front
#: camera's `range_est` already inverts from apparent width, on a camera 17 cm
#: from its subject rather than 40.
PUBLISH_PROXIMITY = os.environ.get("MICRODUCK_MOSS_PROXIMITY", "0") not in ("", "0")
#: **LITTER IS NOT ALL ONE CAN.** Every pick policy here trained on a single
#: 66x115 mm cylinder, so "it generalises to trash" is a claim nothing has
#: tested. A fresh SHAPE per episode costs 23 ms of recompile against a 355 ms
#: episode — MEASURED, 6.6% throughput — so the obvious way is affordable and
#: there is no need to mutate geom types inside a live model.
#:
#: Sizes are bounded by what the jaw can close on: it opens to 82 mm, so a
#: graspable width past ~70 mm is a shape this robot cannot pick and would
#: only teach failure. Mass stays >= 5 g because MuJoCo handles a 1 g object
#: against a 6 kg robot badly.
PROP_VARIETY = os.environ.get("MICRODUCK_MOSS_PROP_VARIETY", "0") not in ("", "0")
#: **THE WRIST DRILL — make the skill HAPPEN so it can be reinforced.**
#:
#: MEASURED across seven runs and ~12M steps, the wrist-to-axis slope was
#: +0.046, +0.021, -0.074, -0.200, -0.134, +0.010: noise about zero, no trend.
#: And it is NOT that the policy stopped exploring — log_std held at -0.51
#: (sigma 0.60) across all seven, so it tried exactly as hard on the last run
#: as the first. Undirected per-step noise explores ACTION space; rolling the
#: wrist to match an axis while descending and closing is a narrow manifold in
#: TRAJECTORY space, and sixty steps of independent noise never assembles it.
#: Turning sigma up would only flail harder.
#:
#: So instead of paying more or randomising more, remove everything that is
#: not the skill. The can spawns LYING, already between the pads, at a random
#: yaw, with the wrist at a random roll — no approach, no driving, no choice
#: of when to close. The ONLY thing that decides the grasp is whether the jaw
#: is square, so a rollout that succeeds is one that aimed, and the credit is
#: unambiguous. This is the same move as the headstand's drill rung and the
#: kick's termination ladder, both of which worked here after reward shaping
#: had stalled ("an unsampled state's value is never learned").

#: **The belief PREDICTS the can, not just the robot.** Between camera frames
#: the fix used to be carried by ego motion alone, which is right for a can
#: that is standing still and wrong for the case this env exists to train: a
#: can that has just been shoved. So successive fixes give a velocity, and the
#: fix is advanced along it — the constant-velocity step every real tracker
#: takes — with the same damping the floor applies, so the prediction stops
#: when the can would.
#:
#: **MEASURED, and it does not pay — so it ships OFF.** `VEL_EMA = 0` holds
#: the belief where it was last seen; any positive value extrapolates. Mean
#: |belief - truth| over 6 seeds, 120 control steps each, against the truth:
#:
#:     setting                     all frames    between camera frames
#:     hold where last seen          15.5 mm            16.4 mm
#:     predict above 0.05 m/s        17.4 mm            21.3 mm   <- worse

#:     predict above 0.30 m/s        15.5 mm            16.4 mm   <- no-op
#:
#: The reason is arithmetic, not implementation: a velocity differenced from
#: two 10 Hz fixes with 15 mm of range noise carries ~0.2 m/s of noise, which
#: is the same size as the shoves it is meant to track. Gate it below that and
#: it extrapolates noise; gate it above and it never fires. A tracker cannot
#: separate a moving can from a noisy one at this frame rate and this sigma.
#:
#: The machinery stays because the measurement is the useful artifact and
#: because the conclusion is a property of THIS detector: at a higher frame
#: rate, or with the D455's depth stream instead of a width-inverted range,
#: the arithmetic changes and `VEL_EMA` is where it turns back on.

#: **The can SHIFTS.** Per control step, the chance of a small random shove —
#: which is what happens on the real floor when a track clips it, and what

#: model teaches only latency; with it, it teaches recovery.
CAN_SHIFT_PROB = 0.02
#: How often the can spawns LYING DOWN rather than standing. Measured from
#: the scripted loop, where the approach topples it far more often than not;
#: 0.5 trains both and keeps the upright case, which is what a can that has

CAN_LYING_P = 0.5
#: **A can CAUGHT MID-TOPPLE**, at an angle that is not a resting pose. The
#: sampler only ever produced the two STABLE poses — exactly upright or
#: exactly on its side — so nothing in training was a can in the act of
#: falling, which is what the approach actually creates: the chassis clips
#: it, it starts over, and the policy meets it at 40 degrees with angular
#: velocity on it. Spotted by a human watching the lab.
CAN_TILTED_P = 0.2
#: The tilt band for that. Not near 0 or 90 — those are the stable cases
#: already covered, and a pose 2 degrees off upright teaches nothing new.
CAN_TILT_RANGE_DEG = (25.0, 70.0)
#: How fast it is falling when the episode starts, rad/s about the tip axis.
#: A tilted can with zero angular velocity is a statue for the first frames;
#: a real one is already going over.
CAN_TOPPLE_RATE = (0.5, 2.5)
#: **The can's POSE randomisation is not domain randomisation.** It was
#: gated on `domain_rand`, which the lab's preview pins False to protect the
#: shared mjModel from being written to — so the watched trainee got an
#: upright can EVERY episode while the trainer saw the 50/50 mix. A resting
#: pose is a qpos choice and writes no model field, so it is separated here
#: and defaults on for both.
CAN_POSE_RAND_DEFAULT = True
#: **A can LEANING against something**, which the sampler cannot produce on
#: its own: every pose it makes is free-standing, so the one case the room
#: actually creates — a can that rolled to the skirting and stopped against
#: it at an angle — was never trained. 6 of 9 undelivered cans in a room run
#: end within 0.25 m of a wall, so this is the state the loop most often
#: gives up on.
#:
#: The support is a low static kerb behind the can, standing in for a wall,
#: a skirting board or a chair leg. It is a REAL obstacle, not a pose trick:
#: the arm has to take the can without driving it into the kerb, which is
#: the thing the room asks for and the bare scene never did.
#: **0.0 — NOT USED, kept as the record of four failed attempts.** The idea
#: is right and the implementation is not: a can posed at a lean angle does
#: not stay there. Placing the kerb along the yaw direction, then along the
#: can's true tip axis, then at a corrected face distance, then letting
#: physics settle it — 0 of 11 cans ended up resting against the obstacle,
#: median 220 mm away from it, because a free cylinder tipping over slides
#: out from under itself rather than leaning.
#:
#: And it BROKE THE DRILL RUNG, which is the part worth keeping: rung 0
#: exists to spawn the can between the pads, and the settle moved it 103 mm
#: away — `test_the_pick_rungs_are_a_spawn_ladder` caught it. A spawn family
#: that silently rewrites another rung is worse than a missing one.
#:
#: What it would take, for whoever picks this up: the can has to be BUILT
#: resting — solve for the contact pose against the kerb rather than posing
#: an angle and hoping — or the kerb has to be a concave corner that a
#: toppling can cannot slide out of. The `lean_kerb` mocap body stays in the
#: scene, parked, so that work does not start from nothing.
CAN_LEANING_P = 0.0

#: under a millimetre, and closing on his 66 mm can at `GRASP_JAW_CTRL_M` it
#: sits ~6 mm short — which is the interference itself, read back through the

#: fine-tune of it score 93% and 91% on the instant test — a tie — and 62%
#: against 25% on this one. The mission ranks them the same way this does
#: (27/72 cans against 16/72), and the OPPOSITE of what the lift rate alone
#: suggested: the fine-tune lifts MORE often (61% vs 53% of creep attempts)
#: and delivers fewer, because the extra lifts are marginal grips that clear
#: the grasp gate and are lost during the carry.
#:
#: One second at 25 Hz, which is long enough for a grip that is only wedged
#: to slip and short enough to leave the episode budget intact.
PICK_HOLD_STEPS = int(1.0 * moss.CONTROL_HZ)
#: **NOT USED.** Scoring the hold alone was
#: still the wrong horizon: trained against it (500k continuation) a leg went
#: from 62% to 81% sustained picks and DELIVERED FEWER cans, 19/72 against
#: the shipped 27/72, with an identical creep->lift rate of 53%. Equal lifts
#: and unequal deliveries puts the whole difference downstream of the lift —
#: in the pose and grip the carry inherits, which this env did not model at
#: all because it ended at the lift.
#:
#: So the horizon was extended: once the hold is proved, ramp to
#: `moss.LIFT_POSE` the way `brain/tidy_moss`'s `lift` state does and require
#: the can still held at the end (`_lift_handover`). **That failed the same
#: check, before anything was trained on it.** Scored over 24 seeds it ranks

        This is the one pick criterion that cannot be misaligned, because it
        IS the mission's metric rather than a proxy for it. Four proxies were
        tried and each failed its check against cans delivered (see
        `PICK_HOLD_STEPS` and `_lift_handover`); the losses are spread across
        the whole carry — the shoulder swing alone takes the hold from 57% to
        40% — so nothing that stops short of the bin can rank a pick leg.

        The policy does not act during any of it, on purpose: in the mission
        every one of these states is scripted, so what is being scored is the
        grip and pose the policy HANDED OVER, which is the only thing it
        controls once the lift begins.

        successes is noise at any reading. Two things defeat it. The signal is
        far too sparse to train on: one delivery attempt per episode at ~12%,
        against the instant test's ~94%. And the env's delivery is not the
        room's: here one attempt is scored from wherever the pick ended, while
        a room run makes about four attempts per can and re-picks what it
        drops, so the two are different denominators rather than the same
        measurement at different fidelity.

        FIVE criteria have now been measured against cans delivered — instant
        pick, sustained hold, lift rate, handover ramp, and this full carry —
        and none of them ranks pick legs the way the mission does. The
        conclusion is not that a sixth is needed. It is that **the pick leg is
        not where the cans are**: the carry loses 69% of what it is handed,

# Carry a gripped can to his own bin and let go of it INSIDE. One env for
# both halves of that, not two, and the reason is the failure it exists to
# fix: the scripted loop drops the can partway through the swing, and a
# carry task that ended when the arm arrived would be scored a success at
# exactly the moment the real loop fails. A handover between a "carry"
# policy and a "release" policy is one more seam for the can to fall
# through, and the seam is the bug. Success here is the can in the bin.

#: Where the can is let go: over the bin's interior, a clear 60 mm above the
#: rim it has to cross. Not the bin's centre — `DROP_POSE`'s docstring has
#: the measurement, the centre is 87 mm out of the arm's reach.
#:
#: This is a target the POLICY has to find its own way to, and that is the
#: point of the task. Ramping the arm straight from the lift pose to
#: `moss.DROP_POSE` — the obvious script — delivers the can 0 times in 10,
#: because `shoulder_lift` stalls 0.379 rad short against `bin_x1`, the bin's
#: own front wall. The jammed servo keeps pushing, so opening the jaws
#: releases the stored energy and the can is FLUNG: measured in the world
#: frame (the base does not move) it travels from x -0.034 to +0.266 while
#: falling 0.43 m, landing in front of the robot instead of in the bin.
#: Every straight ramp tried lands the can 0.45 m up, 0.19 m above the rim.
#:
#: The task is still feasible, which is why this is trained rather than
#: scripted: of 60,000 random arm poses, 179 put the gripper contact-free
#: just above the rim (0.26-0.34 m) and 93 put it contact-free INSIDE the
#: bin. The reachable set contains what the script cannot travel to.
#: The can's destination, and the WAYPOINT it has to be reached through.
#:
#: `STOW_TARGET` is inside the bin, a can's half-height above its floor —
#: where the can is meant to end up. But the distance to it cannot be
#: measured in a straight line, and that mistake is worth keeping written
#: down: the can starts at (+0.264, 0, 0.217) and a straight line to
#: (-0.087, 0, 0.168) passes through the bin's FRONT WALL (x -0.006, which
#: spans z 0.111 to 0.296) about 80% of the way along. It never goes over
#: the rim. Progress-pay on that line is an instruction to push the can into
#: the wall, and the policy did exactly as it was told — watched in the lab
#: it grinds the can against the frame, and ep_rew sat at -35 where the same
#: task aimed above the mouth had reached +1.2.
#:
#: So the distance is measured through `STOW_MOUTH`, over the rim: while the
#: can is not yet over the bin's footprint the gap is (can -> mouth) plus
#: (mouth -> target), and once it is over, it is simply (can -> target). The
#: two agree exactly when the can is AT the mouth, so the term stays
#: continuous across the handover and no reward appears out of nowhere.

#: Progress-pay again, on the distance from the can to that point.
W_STOW = 80.0
#: Keeping hold of it is worth the same 0.3 a step as in the pick env, but
#: as a COST OF LETTING GO rather than income for holding — and that sign is
#: the whole point. Written as income it was MEASURED at +59.5 for a policy
#: that pressed nothing for 200 steps: the pick env gets away with a holding
#: trickle because its episodes end within a second or two of the grip,
#: whereas a carry is long and 0.3 a step of free money for standing still
#: beats delivering. As a penalty for being empty-handed it says the same
#: thing about the can and pays exactly nothing for parking.

#: ONCE, the first time the GRIPPER is over the bin while still carrying.
#:
#: Progress-pay on the can alone cannot buy this, and the measurement is
#: unambiguous: ramping the arm along a route that genuinely works — from
#: the lift pose to a configuration verified to hold a can at z 0.182,
#: inside the bin — the can's distance to the mouth RISES for the first
#: third of the move (0.552 -> 0.581) before falling to 0.438. The working
#: route swings the shoulder round about 3.1 rad, from pan +1.35 to -1.78,
#: and the can goes further away while it does. A greedy progress term
#: punishes precisely the part of the manoeuvre that makes it possible, so
#: the policy contorts to shave millimetres off a straight line instead of
#: turning round, which is what it looks like on screen.
#:
#: One-shot rather than per-step, for the reason the pick env's close bonus
#: is: paid every step, a policy parks its hand over the bin and banks the

#: robot is the pose it would then try to DRIVE in. Nothing in the env even
#: mentions the tuck pose.
#:
#: Paid as progress toward `moss.tuck_pose()` in joint space — the folded pose
#: fitted against this collision model, which the repo's own note calls "a

#: reach at 114.2 mm — IDENTICAL, to a tenth of a millimetre. The tuck is a
#: statement about clearance (it passes the 261 mm bin rim by 1.5 mm), and
#: rolling the gripper about its own axis does not change the silhouette at
#: all. Requiring it cost 2.431 rad of a 5.20 rad residual — the largest

#: **THE RETRACT DRILL — isolate the fold, the way every other stuck skill

#:
#: Seven training attempts failed and in every one the fold COMPETED with the
#: delivery: paying it more collapsed delivery 14 -> 9, DAgger collapsed it
#: 17 -> 6, and staging the reward collapsed it 14 -> 11 with episodes
#: dropping from 305 steps to 46. The policy kept trading the can for the
#: fold, because one episode contains both and only one of them pays early.
#:
#: So take the delivery away. The episode STARTS where a delivery ends — arm
#: over the bin, object already released into it — and the only thing left to
#: do is get home. MEASURED from 38 real post-delivery poses flown by

DROP_PENALTY = -15.0
#: A release is judged by where the can LANDS, not by where it was let go.
#: This is the single worst bug this task has had. Judged at the instant the
#: jaws opened, a can let go over the bin is not yet in it — it is 0.18 m up,
#: because the arm cannot descend to the rim — so the release scored
#: `dropped` and -15. MEASURED on the stage-1 policy: it parks the can
#: directly over the bin footprint 8 times out of 8, and simply opening the
#: jaws there lands it in the bin 8 times out of 8 — and it had correctly
#: learned never to open them, because the env punished the winning move.
#: The episode now keeps running after a release until the can comes to
#: rest, and asks then.
#: **How much of the policy's BASE command survives once the can is within
#: the arm's reach**, in `MossPickEnv`. 1.0 is the env every shipped leg
#: trained in, and it produces a policy that drives flat out for the whole
#: grab: 29,165 creep ticks in the room command base motion on 100% of them,
#: |vx| saturated at 0.200 m/s, |wz| a median 0.808 rad/s, 78% of ticks
#: turning harder than 0.3 rad/s. That is what a human watching the lab

#:
#: Damping it at DEPLOY time only makes things worse — 9, 14, 8 and 15 cans
#: of 36 at scales 0.00, 0.25, 0.50 and 0.75, against 22 unchanged — because

PICK_BASE_REACH_M = 0.30
#: **WHICH DISTANCE THE PROGRESS TERM PAYS FOR — and the reason the base
#: barges.** `POCKET` is a point fixed to the CHASSIS, so `_gap()` measures
#: can-to-chassis and the ARM CANNOT EARN THE DOMINANT TERM AT ALL. MEASURED
#: on 2026-09-25, from the deployed pose at rung 2, 60 steps of full command:

#:     arm only    gripper moved 14.8 cm, the reward's gap moved  0.2 cm
#:     base only   gripper moved 41.1 cm, the reward's gap moved  4.8 cm
#:
#: A 60-weight term paying the base ~20x what it pays the arm is why a policy
#: drives at the can instead of reaching for it, why the penalties totalling
#: -12 against +18 of pay did not stop it, and why clamping the base in reach
#: (`PICK_BASE_REACH_SCALE`) on its own would leave the reward FLAT there —
#: nothing the arm does would earn. Retargeting the term to the GRIPPER makes
#: reaching pay; the base still earns, because driving moves the gripper too.

GAP_FROM_TCP = os.environ.get("MICRODUCK_MOSS_GAP_TCP", "0") not in ("", "0")
#: **A SHOVE ENDS THE EPISODE, instead of costing something affordable.**
#:
#: The reward already charges for disturbing the can (`W_CAN_DISTURB`) and for
#: hitting it with the chassis (`W_CAN_BODY_HIT`), and MEASURED on 2026-09-25
#: it does not matter: the shipped leg picks the can 93% of the time WHILE
#: moving it a median 6.3 cm (mean 17.6, max 108) and commanding both base
#: axes saturated in every condition, including with the can already between
#: its pads. Barging works, so barging is never unlearned. No weight fixes
#: that — the strategy has to stop succeeding.
#:
#: The precedent is this repo's own: reward shaping could not make the G1 kick
#: past 0.10 m, and a DeepMimic-style early termination on a 5 -> 15 -> 30 cm
#: ladder took it to 0.62 m. Same shape here, on the can's NET displacement
#: from where it spawned (path length accumulates the jitter of a can resting
#: against a pad and would abort on contact alone).
#:
#: CALIBRATED against how the policies actually fly today, so that no rung is
#: a structural no-op — the mistake `board_margin=0.25` already made here:

#:     15 cm           28%                   15%

CAN_AT_REST_MPS = 0.05

#: reach, before it counts as let go.
DROP_DEBOUNCE = 4
#: How far the can has to be from the tcp before it is out of the jaws
#: whatever the contacts say — a released can falls clear of this in about a
#: tenth of a second.
CARRY_RADIUS_M = 0.08

#: How long a stow episode runs. NOT the env's 8 s default, and this is the
#: whole reason the task would not train. MEASURED: the policy carries the
#: can over the bin by about step 180, and the episode ended at 200 — so the
#: window in which letting go actually pays was 20 steps wide, a tenth of the
#: episode. Gaussian exploration opens the jaws at a uniformly random moment,
#: which is therefore almost always too early and scores -15, and "never
#: release" becomes locally optimal: all three stages of a chain trained this
#: way scored 0 of 12 into the bin with 10 of 12 STILL HOLDING at the end.
#: The +40 for a delivery was never sampled, so its value was never learned.
#:
#: This is the same mistake as the approach leg's 8.0 s episode against 9.2 s
#: of driving, and it has the same shape: a constant that does not follow
#: what the task actually takes. 20 s leaves ~300 steps of parked time in
#: which opening the jaws is the best thing the policy can do.
#:
#: (The park itself is a JAM, worth knowing: the policy holds a command the
#: arm cannot reach, pressed against the bin's front wall, which is how it
#: gets the can as low as 0.18 m above the rim. Replaying the commanded pose
#: from the lift reaches a DIFFERENT, contact-free configuration that puts
#: the can 0.35 m out in front instead — so a drill rung built by replaying
#: that pose does not reproduce the state at all.)
STOW_EPISODE_S = 20.0

#: Per rung: (how far off centre the can sits between the pads, how far it is
#: tilted). This is the answer to "the can can be in multiple positions" —
#: the pick policy does not hand over a centred can, it hands over whatever
#: it managed to close on.
#:
#: The values are read off the SEAT RATE, measured 20 resets per cell: a
#: square upright can seats 20/20, 4 mm off centre 11/20, 12 mm 5/20, 18 mm
#: 1/20, and any tilt costs about half. So the ladder runs to 12 mm and 0.4
#: rad rather than further: a grip the gripper can barely form is not a grip
#: the pick policy would ever hand over either.
#: The route to the bin, verified end to end: from the lift pose, fold the
#: arm UP and in (clear of the bin), swing the shoulder round, then descend
#: into the mouth. Ramped along these and opened at the end it puts the can
#: in the bin 6 times out of 6.
#:
#: The waypoints are the point. The final pose alone is reachable in free
#: space but NOT by a straight joint-space path from the lift: interpolated
#: directly the arm jams with `shoulder_pan` 0.851 rad short against
#: `bin_x1` (contacts `gripper_mount` and `wrist_link_proxy`) and strands
#: the can out to the side at y +0.215 — 0 of 6. The same trap as the tuck:
#: a pose that is reachable and a path that is not. The rotation has to
#: happen ABOVE the bin.
#:
#: It is NOT the can slipping, which was the first guess and was wrong:
#: measured in the gripper's own frame the can moves 1.9 mm over the whole
#: six-second rotation and the grip never lets go.
#: **The descent reaches the bin's mouth by LEANING ON IT, and that is load
#: bearing.** Ramped to `(-1.776, -0.699, 1.648, -0.722, 1.154)` the arm
#: never arrives: it stalls 0.44 rad short with 33 N against `bin_x1`, the
#: bin's own front wall, on every release of 51. The wall is a mechanical
#: stop, and the configuration it stops the arm in is exactly the one that
#: holds the can over the mouth — x = -0.128 m in the base frame against a
#: mouth of [-0.164, -0.010], z = 0.318 just clear of the 0.261 rim.
#:
#: That was worth an afternoon because it inverts. Searching for a pose the
#: arm could REACH with zero force on the wall found eleven, and the best of
#: them delivers 12/12 in `MossStowEnv` — and 5 of 16 in the room, releasing
#: the can at x = +0.018, z = 0.462: past the mouth and 20 cm too high. The
#: probe and the room disagreed completely, and the ROOM is the mission. The
#: contact was not the bug; it was the only thing putting the gripper in the
#: right place.
#:
#: So `STOW_INSIDE` is now the pose the jam SETTLES at, measured off 25 room
#: releases, rather than a pose commanded 0.44 rad through a wall. Same
#: delivery, a quarter of the force (12 seeds):
#:
#:     commanded past the wall   can x -0.128  z 0.318   12/16   32.8 N
#:     its own resting pose      can x -0.136  z 0.318   12/15    7.3 N
#:     contact-free (probe 12/12) can x +0.018 z 0.462    5/16      -
#:
#: The residual 7.3 N is the arm RESTING on the wall, not a servo driven
#: into it, and that is the part that matters off-sim: the old command held
#: five servos in a stall for the whole release. It is still a delivery that
#: depends on touching the bin, which is a fact about this geometry Laurent
#: should know before it is called a hardware routine.
#:
#: What this does NOT fix is the carry: only 29-33% of lifts still hold the
#: can when the release fires, and that loss dwarfs the drop's.

#: The raise is what makes the task REAL, and leaving it out was a mistake
#: worth recording. Without it the episode began with the jaws merely around
#: a can still standing on the ground — MEASURED, the can sat at z 0.057
#: against a floor height of 0.058 for all 53 steps of a do-nothing episode,
#: then "dropped" when a slow drift broke contact. Nothing was ever carried,
#: so the policy was being trained to keep hold of something it had not
#: picked up, and every episode ended in 4 steps at full action scale. The
#: raise costs retries — it keeps the can 6-7 times in 9, and that band does
#: not move with ramp duration or jaw force — but `SEAT_TRIES` covers it, and
#: a rung that starts with the can in the air is the state the pick policy
#: actually hands over.
#: Tries to seat the can in the jaws before the episode gives up and takes
#: the nominal centred grip. Bounded because an unbounded retry loop in a
