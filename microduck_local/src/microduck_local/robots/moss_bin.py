"""WHERE in the bin to drop the next piece: MOSS's arm camera looks in, a
rule picks the clearest spot.

The split is deliberate (decision 2026-09-26, "option A"): perception and the
choice are SCRIPTED, and the stow policy learns to deliver to whatever spot it
is handed in `moss.OBS_DROP`. The alternative — learning the choice — needs a
summary of the bin's contents in the observation, which is a new contract and
a retrain of every leg.

What is modelled and what is not:

  * The look is taken from `BIN_LOOK_POSE`. NOT the post-delivery pose: from
    there the bin is BEHIND the wrist camera — MEASURED, 0 of 71 clutter
    items detected — so the brain tilts the wrist down into this pose after
    a delivery, looks, and then folds.
  * Each item is detected only inside the arm camera's real field of view and
    range, only if the line of sight clears the bin's walls, with position
    noise and dropout.
  * NOT modelled: occlusion between items, and pixels. A detector reports
    positions; this is the position it would report, not an image.

`choose_drop_point` is pure and frame-agnostic so the brain can call it on a
real detector's output unchanged.
