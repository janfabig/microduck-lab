"""MOSS's WRIST camera — and the front camera's reading of an object's axis
and height — for a robot in a WORLD, computed by the pick env's OWN methods.

`teach-moss_pick-ad9876`, the only pick trained on six shapes, sees four
inputs the world never produced: the object's axis and uprightness
(`moss.OBS_TARGET_AXIS` / `OBS_TARGET_UPRIGHT`, from the wrist camera, else
the front camera), its range from the wrist camera (the target's z slot) and
the height of its top (`moss.OBS_SPARE`). Handed zeros, it measured 4 objects
in the bin over 6 yard seeds against 13 for a can-only pick (2026-09-26).

There is ONE sensor model, not two: `MossTargetSensors` borrows
`MossPickEnv._sense_arm`, `_front_attitude` and `_true_attitude` and gives
them the attributes they read (`data`, `can_body`, `prop`, `driver`, `rng`,
the arm camera's body id and the latency queues). Rate, field of view, range,
noise, dropout, end-on blindness and latency are therefore exactly what the
policy trained under, and a change to the env's model is a change here.

The TARGET is the pickable object nearest the jaws — what the wrist camera is
looking at during a pick; the env has only one object, so it never had to
choose. The caches are cleared when the target changes, so a fix on one
object is never reported as a reading of another.
