"""How long does a duck actually spend in a corner, and does it get OUT? — the
dwell census.

From /sim, again: *"the duck is getting stuck in the corner"*. Item 12m answered
a NEIGHBOURING question — it counted the *stuck-at-a-board* ticks (within 0.35 m,
pointing at it within 35 deg, no ball sighting fresher than 0.3 s) and found 9 s a
duck a 180 s run, with the ball within half a metre 79.7% of the time. It then
attributed the whole thing to the near-field blind radius **of a camera the robot
does not have** (62.3 x 48.8, roadmap 12z). The corner claim inside it - "corners
are not traps, 3.79 s a visit against 5.17 s at a flat wall" - is the number this
probe re-measures, because it was taken on that same wrong lens and a lens twice
as wide changes exactly the quantity the mechanism rests on.

**A total is not a trap.** 9 s spread over twenty 0.5 s brushes is a duck that
handles corners; 9 s in one visit is a duck that is stuck. Both give the same
total, and only the second is what the user is watching. So this probe segments
the occupancy into VISITS and reports the distribution - count, median, p90 and
the worst single visit - alongside the total. `--csv` writes one row a visit so a
distribution can be re-read without a re-run.

    uv run python scripts/probe_corner_dwell.py --seeds 4 --seconds 180
    MICRODUCK_CAMERA="fov_h_deg=62.3,fov_v_deg=48.8,px_h=320,projection=pinhole" \
        uv run python scripts/probe_corner_dwell.py --seeds 4 --seconds 180

The second line is the A/B that matters: the same census under the camera 12m was
measured on. If corner dwell is unchanged between them, the blind radius is not
what holds a duck in a corner and 12m's mechanism does not carry over to the
corner claim.

**Truth, not the brain's estimate**, for where the duck is: this asks whether the
duck IS in the corner, which is a fact about the world. The ball distance is truth
for the same reason; what the brain believes is reported separately as `det_age`,
because the gap between them is the hypothesis under test.
