"""What could each A/B battery on disk ever have resolved?

    cd microduck_local
    uv run python scripts/audit_power.py
    uv run python scripts/audit_power.py --target-pct 10 --metric kickCount

Written after every knob in a run of soccer experiments came back "null" and
the obvious question was whether the knobs were dull or the instrument was.
It is the instrument.  Reading all thirteen A/B batteries on disk:

* **The minimum detectable effect is huge.** Median MDE is 28% of baseline on
  kicks, 19% on ball advance, 33% on falls.  A real 10% improvement cannot be
  seen at these sizes, so it reads as a null.  `goals` and `ballProgress` are
  worse than useless -- hundreds to tens of thousands of seeds for 10%.
* **The paired design buys nothing.** Median between-arm correlation r = 0.05,
  variance reduction 1.03x.  The sim diverges within seconds of any knob that
  fires, so the shared seed cancels no variance.  The one battery where it did
  pay (`t9 hunt`, r = 0.6) is the one whose knob barely fired -- pairing gain
  is a measure of how little the arm perturbed the run, not of a good design.
* **`ballProgress` is noise**: ~21,000 seeds for a 10% change.

`--old-normal` also reports the verdicts that were significant only under the
normal approximation the script used before Student's t was written out (scipy
is not a dependency here, so the normal fallback is what actually ran).  At 24
seeds the untrustworthy band is a reported p between 0.039 and 0.05.
