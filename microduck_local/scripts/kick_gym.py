"""THE KICK GYM: one duck, one ball, one swing, repeated.

The kick is measured in two places today and they disagree, which is why
nobody can fix it:

  * `bench_kick_headdown.py` spawns a STANDING duck at HOME with the ball on
    a chosen offset and fires the skill. 0% whiff. Too clean: no walk-in, no
    settle, no gait phase, a perfectly still ball.
  * `probe_kick_line.py` reads swings out of a contested 2v2 match. 94% whiff
    where the plan puts the ball. Too dirty: opponents, teammates, a
    blackboard, avoid/yield/block, and only 83 swings in the band that
    matters out of 48 seeds x 300 s of compute.

This is the rung between them. ONE duck and ONE ball on a pitch with a goal,
driven by the real `chase` brain, so the approach, the settle, the gait phase
and the stale plan are all REAL - and nothing else is. Every episode is one
placement and one swing, so the swings-per-minute is set by the kick and not
by how long it takes to win possession, and the ball's start is CHOSEN rather
than whatever the match happened to produce.

    uv run python kick_gym.py --episodes 60 --out gym.jsonl
    uv run python kick_gym.py --episodes 200 --jobs 4 --out gym.jsonl

...and `--duel` makes it the rung between them for a SECOND event, the duel
(roadmap C.4): the ball in open play, this duck going for it, and an opponent
already nearer to it. One row per episode, scoring who touches the ball first
and what the OPPONENT'S next touch does with it — the per-event instrument
C.4 asks for after a whole-match ledger could not price the rule.

    uv run python kick_gym.py --duel --episodes 40 --seeds 12 --jobs 3 \
        --arm 'off=' --out runs/duelgym/off-b0.jsonl
    uv run python kick_gym.py --duel --opponents 0 --episodes 16   # the positive control

It prints the same funnel table as roadmap Track 4 item 12, so the two are
read side by side. The question it exists to answer first: does a clean
single-duck approach reproduce the 94%? If it does, the fix can be iterated
here in minutes instead of an hour a battery. If it does NOT, then what
breaks the kick is something only the match has, and that is the finding.

# C.4's own "what would settle it next": a whole-match ledger priced the duel
# rule at an MDE of 3% on possession against a 10% firing rate and resolved
# nothing about the duel itself. The duel is an EVENT — an opponent within
# `duel_near` of the ball and nearer to it than this duck, while this duck goes
# for it — so it wants the instrument this file already is for the kick: place
# the event, run it, and score THE OPPONENT'S NEXT TOUCH rather than the run.
#
# The placement is the definition, made literal. Everything below is a constant
# of the EVENT, not of a brain: no knob reads them, so an arm cannot move the
# population it is measured on.
# The contest window, set by the POSITIVE CONTROL and not by taste: with the
# opponent removed, our duck resolves the episode (touches the ball at all) on
# 58% of episodes at 4 s, 94% at 6 s and 94% at 8 s. Below 6 s a "nobody
# touched it" is mostly the clock; at 6 s it is the contest, which is the only
# reading that makes `first touch` an outcome of the duel.
#
# 6.0 -> 8.0 on 2026-09-24, and the 94%-at-6 s above is now HISTORY: it was
# measured on 2026-09-10 (bd23c3c), five days before `approach_keepout: 0.20`
# began shipping ON as part of the F.2 own-goal pack (16664ee, 2026-09-15).
# The keep-out radius holds the unopposed duck off the ball, so the same
# control now reads, paired by seed over 32 episodes x 6 seeds:
#
#     shipped (keep-out ON)      86.5% mean, 75% worst seed
#     approach_keepout=0.0       93.8% mean, 84% worst seed   <- the old 94%
#     paired delta              -7.3% +/- 2.8% SE, worse on 5/6 seeds
#
# At 6 s that leaves ~13% of UNOPPOSED episodes unresolved, which is a floor of
# "our duck never got there" under every contested arm — exactly what this
# window exists to keep out of the numbers. Re-swept under the shipped pack
# (32 episodes x 5 seeds): 6 s 86.9%, 7 s 94.4%, **8 s 96.2%**, 9 s 94.4%.
#
# The sweep is NOT monotone in the window, because `run_duel` runs its episodes
# back-to-back in ONE `World` — a longer window moves every later episode's
# starting state. Read it as five samples of a noisy surface, not a curve.
#
# The window is widened rather than the pack disabled in the control, because
# the contested arms run the shipped pack too: a control with `approach_keepout`
# pinned to 0.0 would pass while leaving that 13% floor inside the very numbers
# it certifies. This does NOT hide the pack's effect — the pack's cost to a
# CONTESTED duel is what the gym measures, and it is still measured; what the

    from it and pointed at it (going for it), and ONE opponent `DUEL_THEIRS`

    The ball is drawn away from every board by more than the 2 s carry window
    can roll it back from, because an `advance` that is really a rebound is not
    a touch's advance (the same reasoning `--at-boards` exists to separate).
    The opponent's heading is sampled around the ball rather than set facing
    it: half the duels in a match are met side-on, and a placement that always
    squares the opponent up would measure the one pose that suits it.

    With `opp_ids` empty this is the POSITIVE CONTROL — the identical draw for
    our duck, and nobody to contest it — so "we touch first" must read ~100%.
