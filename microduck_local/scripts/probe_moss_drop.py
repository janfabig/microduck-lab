"""Where does MOSS put what it drops, and does it then drive over it?

    uv run python scripts/probe_moss_drop.py 300 0,1,2,3 out.json
    PARAMS="drop_back_m=0.18" uv run python scripts/probe_moss_drop.py ...

A DROP: a prop that was carried comes back to the floor outside the bin — its
position is recorded in the BASE frame, which is what `min_x` filters on. A
RUN-OVER: the base's own footprint passes over a prop while the tracks drive.

MEASURED with it (2026-09-29, 8 seeds): drops land a median 0.293 m directly
ahead and 55% fall inside `min_x`, where the brain cannot see them at all —
but 13 of 16 run-overs are on objects that were NEVER picked up. See
docs/roadmap.md. The run-over count is 0-10 per seed with a paired standard
error of +-2.5, so it CANNOT resolve an intervention at this sample size; use
`probe_moss_shove.py`'s contact seconds for that.
