"""How often could the boards line ACT in a real match? — the deciding census.

The match-level `board_margin` arms came back a tight null on possession
(MDE 5%) and flat on kicks (MDE 18%), and solving the MDE backwards showed a
boards-confined effect of the size the gym measured would have had to fire on
20-39% of kick chances to be visible. Nobody has counted the actual rate. If it
is under ~25%, no affordable `eval-pitch` can settle the scoped claim and the
boards line belongs in the gym with this census printed beside it.

    uv run python scripts/probe_board_census.py --seeds 4 --per-side 2

**Counting the ACT set, not the trigger set.** `board_margin` is its own
feasibility limit: it switches to the boards line when the normal spot is not
clear of the boards, and then `_along_the_boards` must ALSO find a spot that
clears the same margin. Below `gap = margin - kick_side` no such spot exists, so
the branch runs and falls straight through to the shipped spot. A census of
"plans within `margin` of a board" would count those fall-throughs as reach and
report a large firing rate for a knob that is a structural no-op there — the
opposite of the truth. So every plan lands in exactly one of:

    act        the trigger fired AND `_along_the_boards` returned a spot
    wasted     the trigger fired and it returned None (a no-op that still ran)
    clear      the trigger did not fire (the normal spot was already fine)

and the denominator is EVERY kick plan, with `no plan` counted separately
rather than skipped (a rate whose denominator is defined by the outcome is
about the filter, not the physics).

**Corners are reported apart from the flat boards** because they are the only
asymmetry in the geometry: a corner ball is constrained by two boards at once,
so `_along_the_boards` fails there far more often. Pooling them averages a
0%-waste population with a ~47%-waste one and hides the thing worth seeing.

Counterfactual, and honestly so: the run is the SHIPPED brain (`board_margin`
0.0), and each candidate margin is evaluated by swapping the brain's own params
and calling `_clear_of_boards` / `_along_the_boards` — the real methods, never a
reimplementation of them. The ball position is the brain's own estimate, not the
world's truth, because that is what the planner actually steers by.
