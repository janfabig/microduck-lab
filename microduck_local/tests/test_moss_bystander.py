"""Steering round the litter the rover is NOT going for.

`bystander_avoid_m` reads the object memory as obstacles while driving. The
measurement behind it: only 12% of what the driving surfaces touch was ever
inside the brain's target gate, and a quarter to two thirds of it is in the
memory at the moment of contact (`scripts/probe_moss_blindspot.py`). These
are the properties that make it a dodge rather than a flinch, and each one
has been shown to fail against a planted regression.
