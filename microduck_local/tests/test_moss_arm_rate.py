"""What the arm is allowed to ASK FOR — `TidyMoss.arm_rate_cap` / `arm_slew_cap`.

MOSS's servos take a position command at kp 70 with `forcerange` +-2.2 N m, and
the policy's own increment is 0.03 rad at 25 Hz = 0.75 rad/s. The scripted
paths had no such bound: MEASURED over eight 300 s moss-yard seeds
(`scripts/probe_moss_safety.py`, sampling every 2 ms physics step) the brain
commanded one-tick steps of up to **2.750 rad** — 137 rad/s — and the arm
reached 13.6 rad/s, while `shoulder_pan` sat at its full torque clamp for an
unbroken **9.2 s**. Two separate causes, so two separate caps, and these tests
hold each to the thing it fixes:

* a BLEND ran a fixed duration whatever distance it had to cover -> `_paced`
* a STATE TRANSITION is a step input of the servo's tracking lag -> `_slew`

`tests/test_moss.py::test_no_scripted_transition_is_a_step_input_to_the_servos`
is the older half of this and not a duplicate: it asserts a ramp EXISTS in
`deploy` and `tuck`, deliberately "the mechanism rather than a speed, because
the speed depends on the pose". These assert the speed anyway, because that is
what the pose-dependence turned out to cost — `pinch/align`'s ramp existed the
whole time and still demanded 8.4-10.0 rad/s. (That test also cites an XL330's
5.6 rad/s no-load speed; MOSS's arm is SO-101-derived and its servos are not
the duck's, so the number is the right idea about the wrong motor.)
