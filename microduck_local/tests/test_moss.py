    180 degrees, so covering 180 degrees of jaw YAW is the whole requirement,

    OVERRIDES `reset`, so it never ran: `run.json` said `prop_variety: True`
    while every stow episode spawned the same can, and a 2M-step run went by
    testing something its own provenance claimed it was not. The person
    watching asked "are we training the bin with different shapes?" and the
    honest answer was no, despite the config.

    Both resets now call `_maybe_new_prop`, and this is what keeps it that way

    Re-measured 2026-09-25: commanding the arm straight to the tuck pose and

    optimiser to find. `moss.RETRACT_WAYPOINT` is a planner's answer.
