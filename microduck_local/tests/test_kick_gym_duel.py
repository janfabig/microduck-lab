"""The DUEL, as an EVENT the gym can place and score (roadmap C.4, second half).

C.4's first attempt at the duel rule was judged by a whole-match ledger and
resolved nothing about the duel: the best instrument it had was an MDE of 3% on
possession against a firing rate of 10%, which prices the RUN and not the
event. C.4's own "what would settle it next" is this file's subject — build the
duel as a gym episode and score *the opponent's next touch*.

An instrument that decides a rule's fate has to be locked harder than the rule.
What is locked here:

  * THE PLACEMENT IS WHAT IT CLAIMS. The whole event is its definition: an
    opponent NEARER the ball than this duck, at contact range, while this duck
    goes for it. A draw that ever puts our duck nearer is not a duel, and every
    number measured on it would be about something else.
  * THE POSITIVE CONTROL. Remove the opponent and the same draw must read
    "ours" on essentially every episode. This is the check that separates "the
    opponent took the ball" from "our duck never reaches a ball in six
    seconds", and it is what set `DUEL_S` (58% at 4 s, 94% at 6 s — both
    measured 2026-09-10, BEFORE the F.2 own-goal pack began shipping ON; the
    window is 8 s from 2026-09-24 for that reason, and `kick_gym.DUEL_S`
    carries the paired measurement).
  * THE ATTRIBUTION. In a duel both bodies are inside the touch radius, so
    nearest-wins would credit whichever duck the ball was kicked AT. The rule
    is "the ball leaves the body that struck it", and its sign is the one thing
    here that fails silently.
  * THE ROW AND THE BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY. `duel_summ` on a swing row file
    must be `{}` and `exit_summ` on a duel row file must be `{}` — both
    directions, because `scripts/compare_gym.py` is pointed at whatever
    `runs/*.jsonl` is to hand.
  * THE REACHABLE SET, read off the CONSTRUCTED brain, never a fresh
    `ChaseParams()` (verification rule 0). The arm C.4 names — a standoff
    INSIDE `duck_touch` — is precisely the one that can compute itself every
    tick and never reach the elif chain, and the row has to be able to say so.
