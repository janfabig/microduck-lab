# 320 px, 295.7 px/rad, read as a pinhole.
#
# It was `DetectorSpec()`'s default until 2026-09-09, when the fitted module
# turned out to be 116° × 60° (docs/camera-hardware.md §1) and the default moved
# to it. Every test here that asserts *what the gates do* — which sizes are
# marginal, which elevations fall outside the frame, what a wide lens costs
# against a narrow one — is a statement about THIS geometry, so it names it
# rather than inheriting whatever the default happens to be.
#
# That is the bug these tests had. A characterisation that silently follows a
# default stops characterising anything the day the default moves, and reports
# it as nine unrelated-looking failures instead of "the camera changed".
