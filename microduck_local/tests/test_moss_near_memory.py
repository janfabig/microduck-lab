"""The range floor is TWO floors: one for targeting, one for the memory.

`_toys_in_view` fed both `_see` and `_remember`, so `min_x` (0.30 m) did not
merely stop the rover driving at litter it could not reach — it stopped the
brain writing that litter down at all. Measured cost: 7.6-13.3% of every toy
detection, all of it ahead of the front bumper
(`scripts/probe_moss_dropped_dets.py`). These are the three things the split
has to keep true, and each one has been shown to fail without it.
