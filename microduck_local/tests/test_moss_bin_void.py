"""The slot between the hull's top and the bin's floor, and what falls in it.

His collision model tops the `hull` box out at base z 0.100 and starts
`bin_floor` at 0.1082 — an 8.2 mm void running under the whole basket, open
on every side. The `v04_*` shell meshes close it to the eye and to nothing
else: they are `contype 0`. Measured cost before sealing: 4 of 64 moss-yard
seeds lose a prop into it, where it rides for 123-207 s of a 300 s run and is
never collected (`scripts/probe_moss_pin.py`).
